# Fire Enginuity Prototype

This web app is simply an html file with iOS-specific config settings, which make it display as if it were a native app. 
For this reason, our prototype can only be 'installed' on iOS devices.

On mobile Safari (the browser on your iPhone): 
- Go to https://github.com/helencarey/fireEngines/tree/gh-pages
- At the bottom of your browser window, choose 'Share' (box with arrow)
- Select 'Add to Home Screen.'

This is all you need to do to try the app!


//-----------------   
Unfortunately, I don't think the rubberbanding issue can be fixed with html.
