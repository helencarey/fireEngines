# Fire Enginuity

This webApp relies on iOS-specific config settings, so it can only be 'installed' on iOS devices.

On mobile Safari (the browser on your iPhone), go to https://github.com/helencarey/fireEngines/tree/gh-pages
In your browser, choose Share (box with arrow), and then select 'Add to Home Screen.'
This is all you need to 'install' this super simple app.

Unfortunately, I don't think the rubberbanding issue can be fixed in this simple html file.
